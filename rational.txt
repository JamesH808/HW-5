my code starts by defining my various functions like the input menue and output ect. I also define all my global variables. Going to the main function, i print the initial welcome statement wher eit asks for a rational number. then I call my print rational function, which prints the current result and asks the user if they want to add or subtract from the current result or quit. from this choice, my code runs into a while loop which has a switch statement inside. the while loop allows the "invalid option number" error to run until the user gives a valid option for the menue. Then from the user's choice to either add or subtract, it goes to the respective case statement. There I call my inputrational function for the user to input a rational number to add or subtract by. then I perform either addition or subtraction by calling the respective functions. Then I call my reduced format function, which containts my gcd function within it. This allows the function to take the computated function, find the gcd of both numerator and denominator, and then divide the numerator and denominator by the gcd. then my code runs the print rational function, which gives calculated fraction and the menue for continued calculations.
